![](./assets/ico_mafinOven_64_64.png) Oven is a define recipe / set ingreadiance / post-process / wrap it ... Beaking place 

gui for bash with some rerouting.



## what it solves for me

N number of lost / forgotten / misplaced scripts and tasks can be in one place. Rapid / asci / directory / link base system for configuration.

So Cook Book holds sets of recipes. For something what I want / need to do. 

* bash can have graphical output `out of the box`

* instance execution of your recipe

* fast command test place with option to store it as channel in CookBook

* battery alert if battery to low show toast

* button to add record to database.



### after sourcing data

Recipe can be Baked in oven as one shot or long time live process.

stdio is main source of data sourcing for next step

**line** or block of result of text can be postProcess as 

* raw

* secLeft

* percent

* percent bar

* ...

Then it's passing it to wrapping section ...



#### wrapping it

It's possible to set recipe that it can wrapped our product in:

* toast - temporary popup on screen in corner

* external x-terminal-emulator

* log

* [ ] widget / channel of recipe it self

- [ ] to ENV as variable

- [ ] to trigger other channel
